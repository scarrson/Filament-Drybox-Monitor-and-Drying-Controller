# Filament Drybox Monitor and Drying Controller

This code was developed for use on a Raspberry Pi Pico W running CircuitPython. A Pico W communicates with an HTU31 sensor (temp/humidity) via I2C and displays pertinent information to an OLED display and also to MQTT for remote monitoring. The Pico also controls a 120V heater and can be configured for any heating setpoint. Some fault detection and crash recovery/error handling is included.

## Installation

* Install CircuitPython on your Pico W and copy all files from this repository to the CircuitPy drive.
* Note: The *boot.py* file and watchdog can cause your Pico to become unresponsive or constantly reboot, refer to the documentation for the watchdog function and boot.py read/write control for more info.
* Build the circuit as indicated in the schematic.
* Test and troubleshoot your WiFi, *secrets.py*, and MQTT configuration until the Pico W successfully connects and uploads all information.

## Usage

* On power-up: If the rotary encoder button is NOT pressed, the Pico W will boot with Read/Write control and the user will be unable to modify any data on the Pico (normal operation, this allows the Pico to write a persistent heating setpoint and recover from crashes). If the rotary encoder button IS pressed, the Pico W will boot without Read/Write control, and the user will have the opportunity to modify files. Note this will cause the Pico to restart due to the reset and watchdog functionality of the main code, and therefore a user must be quick to remove the code.py or boot.py file while the Pico is writeable. Fun!

* Use the Heat ON/OFF switch to control whether the system is monitoring the drybox or actively heating.
    *   Monitor Mode:
        * Read Temp/RH via I2C + calculate dewpoint. Report to OLED and MQTT every n seconds (default: 60 sec).
        * If the Rotary Encoder hasn't been pressed in n seconds, put it to sleep (default: 600 sec).
    * Heating Mode:
        * Read Temp/RH via I2C + calculate dewpoint. Report to OLED and MQTT every n seconds (default: 5 sec).
        * Never sleep the OLED.
        * User enters a heating setpoint by pressing the rotary encoder and selecting a setpoint. The relay will turn on until the setpoint is reached, using deadband control (ie: for a deadband of 2째C and setpoint of 45째C, heating turns off at 46째C and turns on again at 44C째).
        * If a FAULT is detected - stop heating, resume when fault clears. Fault conditions are: out-of-range temperature values or an I2C device that fails to communicate for >n seconds (default: 10 sec).
        * Indicate status of heating mode active, and heating output active on local LEDs.
        * If Pico W crashes during heating, watchdog detects and resets board. On bootup, Heat ON/OFF switch in ON position, code recovers setpoint from file and resumes heating indefinitely.
* MQTT Variables Reported:
    *   Statuses: Fault, Heating Mode, Heating Output
    *   Analog Values: Fan RPM, Temperature, Relative Humidity, Dewpoint, Setpoint
    *   Error Monitoring: Reboots, Num of I2C errors per sample cycle
